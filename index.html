      <h2><em>About Me</em> </h2>
      <p>My name is <strong>Nicolas</strong> <em>"Andrei"</em> <strong>Dela Cruz</strong></p>
      <p>I recently just turned <strong>21</strong> and decided I want to be a programmer for my career.<p> Before Epicodus I had little to no experience coding, but I always thought the idea of spending all day making websites and applications seemed like so much fun.</p> <p> So I started doing some research on coding bootcamps in Portland and out of several schools, <strong><em>Epicodus</strong></em> stood out the most.</p>
      <p class="p_class"> so here I am now trying to learn as much as I can </p>
    </div>


      <div class="pre-project-description">
      <h3> I've made several small projects throughout the past 4 days.</h3>
      <p> Since this is the first week, most of our projects were very basic.</p>
      <p> But for someone who hasn't coded at all before Epicodus, they were moderately challenging but very rewarding in terms of learning.</p>
      <p> So I picked out three projects I made with three different partners that represents what I have learned so far from coding. </p>
      </div>





   <div class="Intro2">
