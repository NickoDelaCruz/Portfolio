      <h2><em>About Me</em> </h2>
      <a href="myhobbies.html">click me for my hobbies</a>.
      <p>My name is <strong>Nicolas</strong> <em>"Andrei"</em> <strong>Dela Cruz</strong></p>
      <p>I recently just turned <strong>21</strong> and decided I want to be a programmer as a career.<p> Before Epicodus I had little to no experience coding, but I always thought the idea of spending all day making websites and applications seemed like so much fun.</p> <p> So I started doing some research on coding bootcamps in Portland and out of several schools, <strong><em>Epicodus</strong></em> stood out the most.</p>
      <p> Before the program I worked only a couple jobs, one was for Precision Casparts making airplane parts, it was really physically demanding and I hated the job. I left after 8 months.</p>
      <p> So here I am now trying to learn as much as I can and hopefully I can get a Junior Dev job after graduation </p>

    <div class="pre-project-description">
      <h3> I've made several small projects throughout the past <em>four days</em></h3>
      <p> Since this is the first week, most of our projects were very basic.</p>
      <p> But for someone who hasn't coded at all before Epicodus, they were moderately challenging but very rewarding in terms of learning.</p>
      <p> So I picked out three projects I made with three different partners that represents what I have learned so far from coding. </p>
   </div>
    <div class="Vacation">
        <h3> <u>Project 1: Vacation</u></h3>
        <p><strong>Vacation</strong> is a html website my partner (Roger day 3) and I did on Thursday. </p>
        <p> <strong>Note this site was mostly a joke since we had very little imagination and thought it would be funny to have a website that sold vacation packages to <em>North Korea</em></strong></p>
        <p>Our site provided users with general information about the Supreme Leader (Kim Jong-un) of North Korea</p>
        <p> In addition to this, we also provided a streetview and links to other html within the website.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="Music">
       <h3> <u>Project 2: Music</u></h3>
       <p> <strong> Music</strong> is a html site my partner (Kim day 2) and I did on Wednesday.</p>
       <p> This project is a very, very, <strong>basic</strong> html site were it listed Kanye West's music tour on the west coast.</p>
    </div>

    </div class="resort">
        <h3><u>Project 3: Resort</u></h3>
        <p> <strong> Resort</strong> was a fun project to make, again, with my partner Kim.</p>
        <p> Very similar to "Project Vacation" this project we made a resort webpage located in Maui.</p>
        <p> Again very basic but it was the first time I added multiple pictures and backgrounds to my code. So it was a great learning experience.</p>
