      <h2><em>About Me</em> </h2>
      <p>My name is <strong>Nicolas</strong> <em>"Andrei"</em> <strong>Dela Cruz</strong></p>
      <p>I recently just turned <strong>21</strong> and decided I want to be a programmer for my career.<p> Before Epicodus I had little to no experience coding, but I always thought the idea of spending all day making websites and applications seemed like so much fun.</p> <p> So I started doing some research on coding bootcamps in Portland and out of several schools, <strong><em>Epicodus</strong></em> stood out the most.</p>
      <p class="p_class"> so here I am now trying to learn as much as I can </p>
