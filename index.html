      <h2><em>About Me</em> </h2>
      <p>My name is <strong>Nicolas</strong> <em>"Andrei"</em> <strong>Dela Cruz</strong></p>
      <p>I recently just turned 21 and decided I want to be a programmer for my career.<p> Before Epicodus I had little to no experience coding, but I always thought the idea of spending all day making websites and applications seemed like so much fun.</p>
